            <h3>Welcome, I'm Nirmit</h3>
            <p>
                I am a fullstack developer with a wide repertoire of coding knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a web developer, primarily. However, I have so much other knowledge that I tie into my primary field. 
                I have plenty knowledge of network security, machine learning, cloud, virtual machines. 
                The web is a complex ecosystem and without a plethora of knowledge as a basis, 
                it is impossible to understand what is happening; especially when, for efficiency, looks are often deceiving. 
                My knowledge allows me to write more secure, stable, and clean code that is easy to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love math, I admit, which makes it really fun for me to try to find the best possible solution. I just love puzzles. 
                Outside of coding, I often read manga, light novels, and play games with my friends. Seeing something new
                that gets my brain running is exciting, so I, often, read about new innovations in software and general physics.
                I want to work on a team that is as enthusiastic about knowledge as me and works well together. 
                A great team will make me greater as well.

            </p>

                        <p>A quiz website where users are tested on their knowledge on the scale of the universe.
                            The questions help the user realize how big our universe really is. Thinking about the scale of 
                            universe usually helps me put the world into perspective and calms me down. This app 
                            is to help others do the same.

                        <p>Healthify is a simple app where you can find common substitutes for ingredients in recipes.
                            This is an app to help those with dietary restrictions or those worried that their daily 
                            diet is unbalanced. Being a vegetarian, substitutes are very common to my life. But besides
                            that learning how versatile yogurt is as a substitute also led me to make this app 
                            (it can substitute for cream in Indian gravy, eggs in baking, etc). Cooking is a science,
                            and this app provides the equations.
